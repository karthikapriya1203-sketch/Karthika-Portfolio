Portfolio Implementation Plan - Karthika
This plan outlines the creation of a professional, creative, and light-themed portfolio website for Karthika, a B.Tech Textile Technology student.

User Review Required
IMPORTANT

The website will use a light, professional theme as requested.
We will use Pure HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript for maximum compatibility and ease of editing.
No external libraries like React or Framer Motion will be used, keeping the code clean and lightweight.
